# Introduction

This extension for 3D Slicer creates a full-color image stack suitable for bitmap-based multimaterial 3D printing. In contrast to traditional 3D printing methods, this new technique does not require image segmentation (which is a difficult and labor-intensive processing step) and produces highly detailed physical models.

# Caveats

*Please note:*
- this process is only compatible with a limited range of newer printers and not traditional filament-based printers.  See the paper for more detail about the printers for which ths approach has been used.
- the developers of SlicerFab are affiliated with any printer company so we don't know the details about what printers may or may not support SlicerFab now or in the future.
- some of the steps in this printing process require custom python coding to convert the generated bitmaps into files compatible with particular printers.
- we hope to provide more details on workflows that are known to generate prints as we gain experience with compatible printers.

This is meant to be a community effort - if you have experience with this kind of printers please share!

# Usage

2. Install a recent nightly version of [3D Slicer](http://download.slicer.org)
3. Start Slicer, open Extension Manager, and install SlicerFab extension
4. Load data and set up Volume Rendering (see docs and examples at [slicer.org](http://slicer.org)
5. Select the BitmapGenerator module
6. Set the output path (/tmp by default, for windows change to c:/TEMP or something)
7. Click Apply and let the slices get generated.

Any questions? Post it on [SlicerFab discussion in Slicer forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/t/printing-volume-renderings-in-plastic/3017)

Work in Progress - Please use with caution and add improvements if you can.
